# BlackBerry WebWorks Packager Directory
#
#   The BlackBerry WebWorks Packager (bbwp) is required for compiling and packaging
#   BlackBerry WebWorks applications for deployment to a BlackBerry device
#   or simulator.  The bbwp utility is installed with the standalone BlackBerry 
#   WebWorks SDK, and as part of the BlackBerry Web Plugin for Eclipse.
#
#   Please specify the location of the BlackBerry WebWorks Packager in your
#   environment.
#
#   Typical location of bbwp for standalone BlackBerry WebWorks SDK installation:
#     C:\Program Files (x86)\Research In Motion\BlackBerry Widget Packager
#
#   Typical location of bbwp for BlackBerry Web Plugin for Eclipse installation:
#     C:\Eclipse-3.5.2\plugins\net.rim.browser.tools.wcpc_1.0.0.201003191451-126\wcpc
#
#   The ANT script is brittle and requires you to escape the backslashes.
#     e.g. C:\some\path must be C:\\some\\path
#
#   Please remember to:
#     - Double escape your backslahses (i.e. \ must be \\)
#     - Do not add a trailing slash (e.g. C:\some\path)
#
bbwp.dir=C:\\Program Files\\Research In Motion\\BlackBerry WebWorks Packager

# (Optional) Simulator Directory 
# 
#   If sim.dir is not specified, the build script will use the simulator directory 
#   within the Blackberry WebWorks Packager.
#
#sim.dir=C:\\eclipse-3.5.2\\plugins\\net.rim.ejde.componentpack5.0.0_5.0.0.25\\components\\simulator

# (Optional) Simulator Binary 
# 
#   If sim.bin is not specified, the build script will attempt to use the default
#   simulator in the simulator directory.  
#
#sim.bin=9700.bat

# (Optional) MDS Directory 
# 
#   If mds.dir is not specified, the build script will attempt to use the MDS that 
#   is installed with the Blackberry WebWorks Packager.
#
#mds.dir=C:\\eclipse-3.5.2\\plugins\\net.rim.ejde.componentpack5.0.0_5.0.0.25\\components\\mds
